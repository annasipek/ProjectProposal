Problem: As a musician, it is sometimes hard to find other musicians in your area. Especially for people who may be more introverted, finding people you can make music with can be a daunting task. However, it doesn’t always have to be that way. This program will collect and hold profiles of people, allowing them to input various information about themselves such as instruments they play, music they’re interested in, and a short bio, and then you can search for specific things and message people who seem interesting/fit what you need.
